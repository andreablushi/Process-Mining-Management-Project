\section{Introduction}

In modern business processes, predicting outcomes and providing recommendations based on historical data is crucial for improving efficiency and decision-making.
In this project, we use process monitoring and machine learning techniques to analyze a real-life production log and predict whether a process instance will lead to a positive outcome (fast trace: $\text{cycle-time} < \text{avg-cycle-time}$) or a negative outcome (slow trace).
When a negative outcome is predicted, we generate recommendations that suggest changes in the sequence of activities to steer the process towards a positive result.
We then evaluate the effectiveness of our recommendation system by comparing the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes in a test dataset.
